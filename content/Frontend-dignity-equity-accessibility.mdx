Most teams believe dignity, equity, and accessibility matter. The problem is that not all of these values survive the product requirements process or implementation. What’s left is often a general sense of being “values-driven,” not evidence of it.

If these values are going to mean anything in frontend work, they have to become observable. We should be able to point to a sentence, a default value, or an interaction and say: *this exists because we were trying to reduce harm or increase agency for someone in a specific state of mind*.

Most popular applications do a reasonably good job with dignity and equity. It’s difficult to find widely used products that overtly blame users, shame them, or make them feel punished. When those failures surface, they are usually corrected quickly. This aligns with business reality: products that make people feel bad are abandoned.

*Accessibility is different.*

Accessibility is the hardest value to uphold, and the easiest to deprioritize. In many startups, time spent on accessibility is treated as optional or wasteful unless the product explicitly serves users who rely on assistive technologies. In existing codebases, accessibility work is often framed as prohibitively expensive. In new ones, it’s deferred because every minute spent on accessibility feels like a delay to shipping.

The result is that accessibility is the value most likely to be compromised. It's not  because teams don’t care, but because it’s the least visible, the least personally felt, and the easiest to justify postponing.

Accessibility fails differently than dignity or equity because its absence is easy to miss if you are not personally affected by it. A screen reader user will immediately know when a button has no label. A keyboard-only user will instantly feel a broken focus order. But for everyone else, the product appears to work fine. That asymmetry makes accessibility uniquely fragile.

These failures are not theoretical. They are observable. Low-contrast text that fails WCAG ratios. Icon-only buttons with no accessible name. Modals that trap keyboard focus or lose it entirely. Small touch targets that are difficult to activate (Linear I'm looking at you). Dynamic content that updates visually but is never announced to assistive technologies. In each case, the interface does not degrade gracefully. It becomes partially or fully unusable for a class of users.

This is where “values-driven” intent most often collapses. Not because teams don’t care, but because accessibility requires discipline, foresight, and constraints that are easy to rationalize away. It requires teams to care about users they may never meet and problems they may never personally experience.

If we want accessibility to survive the requirements process, it has to be treated as a functional requirement, not a moral aspiration. That means making it observable and enforceable in the same way we treat performance, security, or correctness. Color contrast should be checked, not debated. Keyboard navigation should be testable, not assumed. Screen reader output should be reviewed, not deferred.

The same rule applies across dignity, equity, and accessibility: values only matter when they change decisions. If a value cannot be traced to a specific piece of copy, a default setting, or an interaction constraint, it is not guiding the product—it is decorating it.

The goal is not to be perfect. The goal is to be intentional. To be able to say, with evidence, that a choice was made because it reduced harm, preserved agency, or widened access for someone who would otherwise be excluded. That is what it means to make values real in frontend work.

There is, however, a silver lining. Tools like Claude Code are quickly changing the cost curve of accessibility work.

Claude Code makes it materially easier to bake accessibility into everyday frontend development. It can generate components with correct semantic structure, catch missing ARIA labels, flag contrast issues, and reason about keyboard and screen reader behavior in ways that used to require specialized review. Tasks that once felt tedious or error-prone can now be surfaced early, while code is still being written.

This doesn’t eliminate the need for judgment or testing. Accessibility is not something you can outsource entirely to a tool. But it does remove one of the most common excuses: that accessibility work is too slow, too specialized, or too expensive to justify early on.

The result is a shift in responsibility. When the marginal cost of doing the right thing drops, the decision to skip it becomes harder to defend. Accessibility no longer has to be a deferred cleanup task or a heroic late-stage effort. It can be part of the default development loop.

That is the opportunity. Values don’t survive on intent alone. They survive when the tools, processes, and incentives make the right choice the easiest one to make.
